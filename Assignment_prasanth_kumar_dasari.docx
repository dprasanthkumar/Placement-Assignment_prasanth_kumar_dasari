Python
1.Question 1:
Write a program that takes a string as input, and counts the frequency of each word in the string, there might
be repeated characters in the string. Your task is to find the highest frequency and returns the length of the
highest-frequency word.
Note - You have to write at least 2 additional test cases in which your program will run successfully and provide
an explanation for the same.
Example input - string = “write write write all the number from from from 1 to 100”
Example output - 5
Explanation - From the given string we can note that the most frequent words are “write” and “from” and
the maximum value of both the values is “write” and its corresponding length is 5

2.Question 2: -
Consider a string to be valid if all characters of the string appear the same number of times. It is also valid if
he can remove just one character at the index in the string, and the remaining characters will occur the same
number of times. Given a string, determine if it is valid. If so, return YES , otherwise return NO .
Note - You have to write at least 2 additional test cases in which your program will run successfully and provide
an explanation for the same.
Example input 1 - s = “abc”. This is a valid string because frequencies are { “a”: 1, “b”: 1, “c”: 1 }
Example output 1- YES
Example input 2 - s “abcc”. This string is not valid as we can remove only 1 occurrence of “c”. That leaves
character frequencies of { “a”: 1, “b”: 1 , “c”: 2 }
Example output 2 - NO
